# Solidity Short Projects
This repository holds a few short projects developed with Solidity while enrolled in the course [Master Ethereum and Solidity Programming](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-ethereum-and-solidity-programming-with-real-world-apps) by Andrei Dumitrescu and Crystal Mind Academy.

The projects include smart contracts for a Lottery, an Auction, Crowdfunding events, an ERC20 fully compliant token, and, lastly, the ICO smart contract for that very ERC20 token.
